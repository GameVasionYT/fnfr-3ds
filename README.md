# A WIP port of FNFR to the (New) 3DS
This port is built on the legacy nintendo switch branch, compatible with the [LÖVE Potion](https://github.com/lovebrew/LovePotion) game engine. The latest versions of Funkin' Rewritten now use [love-nx](https://github.com/retronx-team/love-nx) So that code won't work with this.

*Friday Night Funkin' Rewritten* is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3, with the exception of most of the images, music, and sounds, which are proprietary. While FNF Rewritten's code is FOSS, use its assets at your own risk.

Also, derivative works (mods, forks, etc.) of FNF Rewritten must be open-source. The build methods shown in this README technically make one's code open-source anyway, but uploading it to GitHub or a similar platform is advised.
